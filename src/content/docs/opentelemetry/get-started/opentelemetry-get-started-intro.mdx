This page provides an overview of the various options available when using OpenTelemetry with New Relic.

While OpenTelemetry offers a broad scope encompassing core components like APIs, instrumentation libraries, the Collector, semantic conventions, and the OTLP protocol (see the OpenTelemetry Project for details), New Relic prioritizes seamless integration, making it easy to leverage OpenTelemetry tools.

The pages referenced below focuses on common integration patterns, providing a foundation for utilizing OpenTelemetry effectively with New Relic. While not exhaustive, it highlights how users typically leverage these tools and the New Relic platform capabilities built upon them.

Here are some common monitoring scenarios:

* APM monitoring: Monitor your applications and services by configuring the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporter to send data to New relic via the New Relic OTLP endpoint. To get started, see [APM: Monitor apps and services with OpenTelemetry](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/apm-monitoring/opentelemetry-apm-intro/)

* Infrastructure monitoring: Monitor your infrastructure hosts, containers, and more by configuring the the OpenTelemetry collector to send data to New Relic. To get started, see [OpenTelemetry Collector for infrastructure monitoring](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-infra-monitoring/opentelemetry-collector-infra-intro).

* General data processing: Monitor all other data by using the OpenTelemtry Collector to receive, process (enriching, transforming, sampling, filtering, etc), and export telemetry data to New Relic. To get started, see [OpenTelemetry Collector for data processing](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started/collector-processing/opentelemetry-collector-processing-intro).
