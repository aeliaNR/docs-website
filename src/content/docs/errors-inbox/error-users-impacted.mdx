New Relic agents automatically capture data about user impact.When you organize by error group, you can see how many users are affected by errors. This helps you prioritize where to focus your debugging efforts by showing you the errors with the highest numbers of users affected.

    Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM & Services > Errors (errors inbox) > Triage**: You can find users impacted in the second column of the **Error groups** table, located beneath the **Error count** and **Error rate** time series.

## Custom attributes to track users impacted  [#getting-started]

In some cases, an error event may not have attributes that identify the end user affected by the error event. You can manually add custom attributes so our agents can capture user identifying metadata at the time of ingest. 

For cases where you need to add a custom attribute for users impacted, we recommend reviewing [OpenTelemetry's attribute conventions](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction). There are multiple common conventions for naming end user attributes.
For example, one [OpenTelemetry standard](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/span-general/#general-identity-attributes) uses `enduser.id`. We'll use the following attributes in order of priority:

    * `userId`
    * `user`

You can review how New Relic processes custom attributes by reviewing our [Collect custom events doc](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/collect-custom-attributes/#enabling-custom).

## Query for users impacted [#query]

The number of users impacted on an error group is recorded as a [Metric data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/metric-data-type/) with the name `newrelic.error.group.userImpact`. You can use this metric with the following NRQL string:

```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(newrelic.error.group.userImpact) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.userImpact'
```

The metric captures the approximate number of unique users in the time period selected. Additional attributes provided by the `userImpact` metric which can be used in a `FACET` clause are `error.group.guid`, `entity.guid`.

## Alert on users impacted [#alert]

By creating an [NRQL alert condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/), developers can trigger <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> when the amount of users impacted by errors exceeds a threshold.

Creating this alert requires determining the [NRQL query](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) which measures the amount of users impacted in a way which best captures your use case.

As an example, the following NRQL query measures the amount of unique users which have been impacted by an [error group](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#groups) coming from a specific entity:

```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(newrelic.error.group.userImpact) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.userImpact' 
AND entity.guid='RXxCUk9XU9182nNEFQUExJQ0FLsU9OfDgzNzgwNw' FACET error.group.guid TIMESERIES
```

Read more about using the [`uniqueCount()`](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/) function, [how to find the entity GUID](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#find) for your entities.

Similarly, the following NRQL query measures the total number of users impacted by errors from all entities under the account in the last hour:

```sql
SELECT count(newrelic.error.group.userImpact) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='newrelic.error.group.userImpact' SINCE 1 hour ago TIMESERIES
```

Once you have decided on a NRQL query, it can be used to create a [NRQL alert condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create).

To improve the signal to noise ratio of your triggered alerts see [alert creation tips](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#condition-tips), [how alert thresholds are evaluated](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#advanced-signal), and [alert condition examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#examples).

## Set users impacted with setUser method [#set-users]

You can use an agent method to identify an end user. See implementation details for each agent below:

* [Java](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/attributes/java-agent-attributes/#user-attributes)
* [Go](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/api-guides/guide-using-go-agent-api/#user-tracking)
* [.Net](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/itransaction/#setuserid)
* [Node.js](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/nodejs-agent-api/#setUserID)
* [Python](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/setuserid-python-agent-api/)
* [Ruby](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/sending-handled-errors-new-relic/#user-tracking)
* [Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/setuserid/)
* [Mobile](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/report-mobile-monitoring-custom-events-attributes/#track-user)
